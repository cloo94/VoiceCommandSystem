# VoiceCommandSystem
The Voice Command System for Raspberry Pi Model B+ uses a microphone to record short audio segments, analyzes them, and can respond to speech and recognize commands. It is also able to recognize music and identify songs. It is based off of Steven Hickson's PiAUISuite (github.com/StevenHickson/PiAUISuite) , but with additional features, and makes use of the Wolfram Alpha API (products.wolframalpha.com/api) and ACRCloud API (acrcloud.com).
